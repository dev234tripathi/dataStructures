Algorithm
1. Starting at root, find the deepest and rightmost node in binary tree and node which we want to delete.
2. Replace the deepest rightmost node’s data with node to be deleted.
3. Then delete the deepest rightmost node.

Note: We can also replace node’s data that is to be deleted with any node whose left 
and right child points to NULL but we only use deepest node in order to maintain the Balance of a binary tree.
